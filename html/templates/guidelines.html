<h3>Background</h3>
<h4>Metadata and data</h4>
<p>
Metadata is structured information for describing things we care about.
It looks like text with extra punctuation to mark different regions,
and elements and values within those regions.  That structure makes the
information readable by software, which in turn helps us organize,
manage, analyze, and discover things we care about.
</p>
<p>
Real computational power comes when there is wide agreement on metadata
terms &ndash; on element names and the values they take on.  The goal of
YAMZ is to support finding, creating, and achieving community accord on
high-quality terms.  These are the terms that you and others will use
to create high-quality metadata. Unlike a regular dictionary, the
metadictionary is about terms used to create <i>structured</i>
(machine-readable) information.
</p>
<p>
The metadictionary supports data too.  Like metadata, data is structured
information, but with a shift in emphasis away from being <i>about</i> a
particular thing.  Some people claim there's no important difference
between data and metadata.
</p>

<h4>Assertions about things</h4>
<p>
Metadata looks like a group of assertions about a particular thing, such
as a document.  For example, metadata may assert that a given document's
title is X, it's author Y, and it's publication date Z.
</p>
<p>
Term definitions often refer to the thing being described with a word
like "thing", "resource", or "object", eg, a title could be "A name given
to the resource".  Which exact thing is being referred to cannot be found
in a term definition.  Instead it is revealed in metadata values or by
context; for example, metadata inside an image file often describes the
image elsewhere in the same file.
</p>

<h4>Elements and values</h4>
<p>
Lots of terms define metadata/data elements, which are small categories
of information, such as "title", "author", or "response".  An element
might also be a structured statement that itself contains other elements;
for example, a "location" that contains "latitude" and "longitude".
Other elements are meant to take on metadata/data values, for example,
pieces of text or personal names.
</p>
<p>
Terms also help with metadata/data values, especially when they are
limited in some way.  For example, a "response" element might be one of
"yes", "no", or "maybe".  A "count" element might take an infinite number
of values, but always restricted to "integer".
</p>
<h3>The metadictionary</h4>
<h4>What it is for</h4>
<p>
YAMZ is an open vocabulary of metadata terms from all domains and
from all parts of metadata speech.  You are free to use YAMZ to search
for, use, share, and reference term definitions, as well as to create and
edit your own terms, and comment on others' terms.  Those freedoms are
granted provided you take responsibility for your edits, and in using
YAMZ you support a civil environment, do not violate copyright or other
laws, and do no harm to its technical infrastructure.
</p>
<h4>What it is not</h4>
<p>
YAMZ is not
<ul>
<li>... an encyclopedia. A definition is approximately one sentence,
    not an essay.
</li>
<li>... a grammar. Whether a term is required or optional is out of
    scope.  A term is like a nano-standard, and its definition may link
    out to external documents specifying rules for given communities.
</li>
<li>... a regular dictionary. While there appear to be many natural
    language terms, they are actually formal jargon inspired by natural
    language.  YAMZ should only contain terms that directly support
    machine-readable descriptions and the metadictionary itself.
</li>
<li>... a bunch of sub-vocabularies. If your working group in the XYZ
    domain wants its own version of thingummy, resist the temptation to
    create XYZ_thingummy, or similarly making the domain part of the term.
    Instead consider creating thingummy and tagging it #XYZ so your group
    can narrow its focus to #XYZ terms on demand.  It is a feature that
    YAMZ is ultimately one large, flat namespace with no domain borders.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Term parts</h3>
<p>
Terms consist of several parts:  a term string, definition, unique concept
identifier, example section, and comments section.  Term definitions
should be in English.  Newlines (line breaks) are preserved on display.
</p>

<a name="#termstring"></a>
<h4>Term string</h4>
<p>
A term string (or label) is one or more words indicating how we speak about
the concept being defined.

<ul>
<li>A term string should contain only letters, digits, hyphens, and
    underscores.  If it has more than one word, exactly one space
    separates each word.
</li>
<li>Although definitions are in English, the term string may be derived
    from any natural language.  Whatever its origin, consideration should
    be given to making it easy to spell, pronounce, and use in English
    sentences.
</li>
<li>Prefer creating a term in the singular form, and in such a way that
    the plural form need not also be defined.  This approach is often
    easier, clearer, and more flexible than creating a term in the plural
    form.
</li>
<li>A term string need not be unique in the metadictionary, but consider
    carefully if you want to re-use an existing string.  Either way, each
    term gets a unique and persistent concept identifier when it is first
    created.  Two terms with the same term string may be meant to compete
    with or to complement each other.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name="#termdef"></a>
<h4>Term definition</h4>
<p>
With the term string established, your term definition should consist
of two main parts (see <a
href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/622/01/">[1]</a> and
<a href="https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/def.html">[2]</a>):
<ul>
<li>The class of thing to which the term belongs, followed by
</li>
<li>differentiating characteristics that distinguish it from all others
of its class.
</li>
</ul>
In particular, a definition (in the singular form) should start with
the article "A", "An", or "The".  As an example, for the term "water",
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A clear liquid made up of hydrogen and oxygen molecules.
</p>
the class is "clear liquid".  If the term string is an acronym, expand it
inside parentheses (using capital letters to delineate the acronym), and
insert the expansion at the very beginning of the definition.
As an example, for the term "ABC",
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Apple Bovine Cooler) An ointment for treating overheated cows.
</p>

<a name="#examples"></a>
<h4>Examples and comments</h4>
<p>
Text in the examples and comments can use all of the references described
below.  As in definitions, newlines (line breaks) are preserved on display.
</p>

<h4>Referencing</h4>
<p>
In term definitions, examples, and comments you can create actionable
links to words and concepts defined in YAMZ and elsewhere.
</p>
<h5>Term references</h5>
<p>
When you create or edit text, a construct like
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#{t: <i>multi-word term string</i>}<br>
or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&amp;<i>term</i>
</p>
<p>
refers to a term (the second is a shorthand for when the term string
consists of just one word).  After you save your editing, YAMZ converts
this to a standard internal form:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#{t: <i>term string</i> | <i>concept identifier</i>}
</p>
On display this reference will look like an ordinary link to the named
term, and when your mouse hovers over it that term's definition should
appear.  Term references can be used liberally inside definitions,
examples, and comments.
</p>
<h5>Tag references</h5>
<p>
Tag references are like term references, but are meant to appear only in
definitions, where a group of one or more tags should be separated from
the end of the definition by a single newline.  A tag identifies a
sub-community, such as a working group trying to focus on a subset of
terms in YAMZ for the duration of its work.  On editing, a tag looks
like:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#{g: <i>tag string</i>}<br>
or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#<i>tag</i>
</p>
<p>
On display a tag looks like a link inside a tile.  When you hover over it
a definition should appear (yes, a tag takes a definition, just like a
term), and when you click on it YAMZ performs a search for all terms
bearing that tag.
</p>
<h5>External links</h5>
<p>
If you need to, you can also add general links to external content using
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#{k: <i>link string</i> | <i>URL (web address)</i>}<br>
or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#{k: <i>URL (web address)</i>}
</p>
<p>
These links are not to be used in the definition proper, but they may
appear in a separate note, such as,
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Note: context for this term's use may be found at #{k: example.com/xyzterms}.
</p>

<h4>Defining values or substructure</h4>
<p>
You can list the values or elements that a given term takes on by adding
them to the end of its definition (but before any tags).  When a term
takes elements (has substructure), first start the definition with
something like
"A <a href="http://www.yamz.net/term=h1237">structured statement</a>
defining ...", followed by distinguishing characteristics.  Then, at the
end of the definition (but before any tags), add a newline, "Elements: ",
and a list of elements.  For example, a definition for "collector" might
look like this:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A person who collects things of a certain type.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Elements: &age, &height, &weight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#geology, #botany
</p>
<p>
A term may have either an element list, a value list, or neither, but not
both.  A value list should also be placed at the end, as in:
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Values: &yes, &no, &maybe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
#finance<br>
</p>
