<h4>Metadata and data</h4>
<p>
Metadata is structured information for describing things we care about.
It looks like text with extra punctuation to mark different regions,
and elements and values within those regions.  That structure makes the
information readable by software, which in turn helps us organize,
manage, analyze, and discover things we care about.
</p>
<p>
Real computational power comes when there is wide agreement on metadata
terms &ndash; on element names and the values they take on.  The goal of
YAMZ is to support finding, creating, and achieving community accord on
high-quality terms.  These are the terms that you and others will use
to create high-quality metadata. Unlike a regular dictionary, the
metadictionary is about terms used to create <i>structured</i>
(machine-readable) information.
</p>
<p>
The metadictionary supports data too.  Like metadata, data is structured
information, but with a probable shift in emphasis away from being
<i>about</i> a particular thing.  Some people claim there's no important
difference between data and metadata.
</p>

<h4>Things and assertions about them</h4>
<p>
Metadata looks like a group of assertions about a particular thing, such
as a document.  For example, metadata may assert that a given document's
title is X, it's author Y, and it's publication date Z.
</p>
<p>
Term definitions often refer to the thing being described with a word
like "thing", "resource", or "object", eg, a title could be "A name given
to the resource".  Which exact thing is being referred to cannot be found
in a term definition.  Instead it is revealed in metadata values or by
context; for example, metadata inside an image file often describes the
image elsewhere in the same file.
</p>

<h4>Elements and values</h4>
<p>
Lots of terms define metadata elements, which are small categories of
information, such as "title", "author", or "response".  An element might
also be a structured statement that itself contains other elements; for
example, a "location" that contains "latitude" and "longitude".  Other
elements are meant to take on metadata values, for example, pieces of
text or personal names.
</p>
<p>
Terms also help with metadata values, especially when they are limited
in some way.  For example, a "response" element might be one of "yes",
"no", or "maybe".  A "count" element might take an infinite number of
values, but always restricted to "integer".
</p>
<h4>What the metadictionary is not</h4>
<p>
YAMZ is not
<ul>
<li>... an encyclopedia. A definition is approximately one sentence,
    not an essay.
</li>
<li>... a grammar. Whether a term is required or optional is out of scope.
    A term is like a proposed nano-standard, and its definition may link
    out to external documents specifying rules for given communities.
</li>
<li>... a regular dictionary. While there appear to be many natural
    language terms, they are actually formal jargon inspired by natural
    language.  YAMZ should only contain terms that directly support
    machine-readable descriptions and the metadictionary itself.
</li>
<li>... a bunch of sub-vocabularies. If your working group in the XYZ
    domain wants its own version of thingummy, resist the temptation to
    create XYZ_thingummy, or similarly making the domain part of the term.
    Instead consider creating thingummy and tagging it #XYZ so your group
    can narrow its focus to #XYZ terms on demand.  It is a feature that
    YAMZ is ultimately one large, flat namespace with no domain borders.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Term parts</h3>
<p>
Terms consist of several parts:  a term string, definition, unique concept
identifier, example section, and comments section.
</p>

<h4>Term string</h4>
<p>
A term string (or label) is one or more words indicating how we speak about
the concept being defined.

<ul>
<li>A term string should contain only letters, digits, hyphens, and
    underscores.  If it has more than one word, exactly one space
    separates each word.
</li>
<li>Although definitions are in English, the term string may be derived
    from any natural language.  Whatever its origin, consideration should
    be given to making it easy to spell, pronounce, and use in English
    sentences.
</li>
<li>Prefer creating a term in the singular form, and in such a way that
    the plural form need not also be defined.  This approach is often
    easier, clearer, and more flexible than creating a term in the plural
    form.
</li>
<li>A term string need not be unique in the metadictionary, but consider
    carefully if you want to re-use an existing string.  Either way, each
    term gets a unique and persistent concept identifier when it is first
    created.  Two terms with the same term string may be meant to compete
    with or to complement each other.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>Term definition</h4>
<p>
With the term string established, your term definition should consist
of two main parts (see <a
href="https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/622/01/">[1]</a> and
<a href="https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/def.html">[2]</a>):
<ul>
<li>The class of thing to which the term belongs, followed by
</li>
<li>differentiating characteristics that distinguish it from all others
of its class.
</li>
</ul>
In particular, a definition (in the singular form) should start with
the article "A" or "The".  As an example, for the term "water",
<blockquote>
A clear liquid made up of hydrogen and oxygen molecules.
</blockquote>
the class is "clear liquid".  If the term string is an acronym, expand it
inside parentheses (using capital letters to delineate the acronym), at
the very beginning of the definition.  As an example, for the term "ABC",
<blockquote>
(Apple Bovine Cooling) A treatment for overheated cows involving an
ointment extracted from apples.
</blockquote>
</p>

<h4>Referencing terms, tags, and external links</h4>
<p>
When term definitions, examples, and comments refer to words and concepts
defined in YAMZ and elsewhere, you can create actionable links to them
with special notation.  When you create or edit text in these parts of a
term, be aware of constructs that look like
<blockquote><pre>
#{t: &lt;term string&gt; | &lt;concept identifier&gt;}
#{g: &lt;tag string&gt; | &lt;concept identifier&gt;}
#{k: &lt;link string&gt; | &lt;URL/web address&gt;}
&foo (which is shorthand for) #{t: foo}
#foo (which is shorthand for) #{g: foo}
</pre></blockquote>
</p>

<!--
All metadata structure definitions should begin like this:
   A _structured statement_ that ....  Elements: <element1>, ..., <elementN-1>, <elementN>  [no period, no
"and"]
<p>
</p>
All metadata structure definitions should end like this:
   Elements: <element1>, ..., <elementN-1>, <elementN>  [no period, no "and"]
<p>
</p>
For an element with controlled values:
   A <noun> that ....  Values: <value1>, ... <valueN-1>, <valueN>
<p>
</p>
To add a tag, put #tag at the _very_ end of the definition (after elements and values).
<p>
</p>

   Definition: (Provider Descriptive Profile) A structured statement that ...
