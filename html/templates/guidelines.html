<h4>Metadata and data</h4>
<p>
Metadata is structured information for describing things we care about.
It looks like text with extra punctuation to mark different regions,
and elements and values within those regions.  That structure makes the
information readable by software, which in turn helps us organize,
manage, analyze, and discover things we care about.
</p>
<p>
Real computational power comes when there is wide agreement on metadata
terms &ndash; on element names and the values they take on.  The goal of
YAMZ is to support finding, creating, and achieving community accord on
high-quality terms.  These are the terms that you and others will use
to create high-quality metadata. Unlike a regular dictionary, the
metadictionary is about terms used to create <i>structured</i>
(machine-readable) information.
</p>
<p>
YAMZ supports data too.  Like metadata, data is structured information,
but with a shift in emphasis away from being <i>about</i> one particular
thing.
</p>
<h4>Things and assertions about them</h4>
<p>
The structured information in metadata is usually a group of assertions
about a particular thing, such as a document.  For example, metadata may
assert that a given document's title is X, it's author Y, and it's
publication date Z.
</p>
<p>
Term definitions often refer to the thing being described using a word
like "thing", "resource", or "object", eg, "Title: A name given to the
resource".  Which exact thing that is cannot be found in a term
definition.  Instead it is usually revealed by metadata values or context
(eg, metadata embedded in a file can often be assumed to describe the
rest of the file).
</p>
<p>

To be useful across lots of software and domains, that the elements and value
A blob of metadata "record" describing a "thing" consists of one or more statements
that themselves may contain smaller statements, all the way down to the
finest levels of structure: named elements and their values.  Such a
record may exist in a digital file or a database, and the described thing
might be a the same digital file, a file nearby, or a physical object.
</p>
<p>
What most concerns the YAMZ metadictionary, however, is coming up with
a common vocabulary of named elements, and often their values, from which
people can describe things by putting together the best structured
statements (metadata records), that is, the ones that are as widely
understood as possible.  It is aggressively cross-domain and includes
all parts of metadata speech -- names, values, encodings, etc.  This is
not the first online dictionary of metadata; it is Yet Another Metadata
Zoo (YAMZ).
</p>
<h4>What makes the metadictionary useful</h4>
<p>
Focus is on terms used for creating machine readable descriptions.
Natural language can inform and inspire term definitions, but it should
not be used to define natural language terms unless they are proposed
for use as machine-readable jargon.
https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/622/01/
https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/def.html

Use #foo or #{foo} or #{t:foo} to reference a term.
xxx use !foo to reference term? and #foo for a tag?
xxx Use ##foo to reference a group?
use #{k: text|link}

Term strings (labels) should only contain [\w \-] (eg, no punctuation)
 xxx no '-'?
often assume an object as subject of description
prefer to define in the singular, then use in plural form
YAMZ is not
 - an encyclopedia - definitions are short, one-sentence
A typical definition reads:  A(n) <noun> that ...
All metadata structure definitions should begin like this:
   A _structured statement_ that ....  Elements: <element1>, ..., <elementN-1>, <elementN>  [no period, no
"and"]
All metadata structure definitions should end like this:
   Elements: <element1>, ..., <elementN-1>, <elementN>  [no period, no "and"]
For an element with controlled values:
   A <noun> that ....  Values: <value1>, ... <valueN-1>, <valueN>
To add a tag, put #tag at the _very_ end of the definition (after elements and values).
To define an acronym, _begin_ the definition with the expansion, using
capital letters to indicate letters belonging to the acronym, eg,
   Term: PDP
   Definition: (Provider Descriptive Profile) A structured statement that ...
</p>
      
      <p>
          The YAMZ Metadictionary is an open registry of metadata terms from
	  all domains and from all parts of "metadata speech".  With no login
	  required, anyone can search for and link to term definitions.
	  Register once, then login to create and edit your terms.
	  YAMZ was initially developed in 2013-2014 by a Metadata Working
	  Group within the NSF-funded
	  <a href="http://www.dataone.org">DataONE</a> initiative, and
	  extended with support from the
	  <a href="https://www.diglib.org">Digital Library Federation</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
          The metadictionary aims to be a high-quality cross-domain metadata 
          vocabulary that is directly connected to evolving user needs.
	  Change will be rapid and affordable, with no need for panels of
	  experts to convene and deliberate to improve it. We expect dramatic
	  simplification of vocabulary evolution compared to traditional
	  methods that have created an overwhelming number of vocabularies
	  (ontologies) to choose from.
      </p>

      <p>
          The hope is that users (people creating machine-readable
	  descriptions of objects they care about) will be able to find
	  most of the terms they need in <i>one place</i> namely, the
	  Metadictionary.  One vocabulary, one namespace.  This should
	  reduce the number of namespaces, namespace clutter, and the
	  expense of maintaining crosswalks with other vocabularies.
          And the vocabulary is "shovel-ready" for linked data application,
	  each term having its own permalink (an ARK identifier).
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The source code for the YAMZ metadictionary is available on
        <a href="http://www.github.com/nassar/yamz">Github</a> as a Python
	package under a BSD open source license.
	<a href="/api">Full API documentation</a> is also available.
      </p>

      <h3>Basic metadictionary structure</h3>

      <p>
          Across the dictionary there are three disjoint term classes.
	  Classification is ongoing and fully-automated, based on voting
	  and user reputation. 
          
          <h4>Vernacular</h4>
            <li>all terms are born here and considered to be works-in-progress</li>
            <li>unstable terms; permalink points to a definition that may change</li>
            <li>anyone can propose new vernacular terms</li>
            <li>proposer(s) of a term "own" it initially; only they can make changes</li>
            <li>communities of interest spring up around related term clusters</li>
            <li>term tagging make it easy for communities (eg, working groups) to switch focus to selected term subsets</li>

          <h4>Canonical</h4>
            <li>terms safe for short- or long-term reference</li>
            <li>stable terms; permalink points to an unchanging definition</li>
            <li>terms move from vernacular to canonical by consensus</li>
            <li>terms still subject to voting</li>

          <h4>Deprecated</h4>
            <li>stable terms, but deprecated for long-term reference</li>
            <li>terms move from canonical to archival by consensus</li>
            <li>archival terms have links such as "ObsoletedBy: term X"</li>
      </p>

      <h3>CC0</h3>
      <p>
          All parts of every term, including definitions, examples, and illustrations are 
          dedicated to the public domain under the terms of the CC0 license. 
      </p>
