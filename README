Thus far, the SeaIce metadictionary consists of a database API and a 
command line tool called "sea". Before you get started, you need to set 
up a database and some software packages. On Ubuntu, grab the follwoing:
  
  python-flask . . . . . . . simple HTTP server.

  mysql-server . . . . . . . We're using MySQL as our database for the 
                             moment. 

  python-pip . . . . . . . . Package manager for additional Python 
                             programs. 

We need to download a package from pip that handles configuration files
nicely. Do: 

  $ sudo pip install configparser

Now set up a database in MySQL: 

  $ mysql --user=USER --password=PASS
  mysql> create database DBNAME (such as seaice) 
  mysql> commit
  mysql> exit

Lastly, create a configuration file for the database and user account
you set up. Create a file called ~/.seaice like: 

[default]
dbname = seaice
user = USER
password = PASS

Then you should be good to go! To test everything is sane, do: 

  $ ./sea --init-db

Have fun! -Chris
