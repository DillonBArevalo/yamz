Thus far, the SeaIce metadictionary consists of a database API, a 
command line tool called "sea", and an HTTP server frontend called "ice". 
Before you get started, you need to set up a database and some software 
packages. On Ubuntu, grab the follwoing:
  
  python-flask . . . . . . . Simple HTTP server.

  postgresql . . . . . . . . We're using PostgreSQL for databse managment. 

  python-psycopg2  . . . . . Python API for PostgreSQL.

  python-pip . . . . . . . . Package manager for additional Python 
                             programs. 

We need to download a package from pip that handles configuration files
nicely. Do: 

  $ sudo pip install configparser

Now set up a database in postgres. First, we need to do some configuration. 
Postgres requires an administrative user called 'postgres'. In addition,
we'll create three users ("roles" in postgres jargin) for our databse. First,
set postgres' password: 

  $ sudo -u postgres psql template1
  template1=# alter uesr postgres with encrypted password 'PASS';  
  template1=# \q [quit] 

now configure the authentication method for postgres and all other users 
connecting locally. In /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf, change "peer" 
in line

 local   all         postgres                          peer

to "md5" for the administrative account and local unix domain socket 
connections. . Next, we wnat to only be able to connect to the database from 
the local machine. In /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/postgresql.conf, uncomment the 
line

 listen_addresses = 'localhost'

Finally, log back into postgres to add users:

  $ sudo -u postgres psql
  postgres=# create user admin with encrypted password 'PASS';
  postgres=# create user viewer with encrypted password 'PASS';
  postgres=# create user contributor with encrypted password 'PASS';
  postgres=# create database seaice with owner admin;

(Using unique, completely random passwords is a good idea here.) Lastly, 
create a configuration file for the database and user account you set up. 
Create a file called ~/.seaice like: 

  [default]
  dbname = seaice
  user = admin
  password = PASS
  [viewer]
  dbname = seaice
  user = viewer
  password = PASS
  [contributor]
  dbname = seaice
  user = contributor
  password = PASS

Set the correct file permissions with: 

  $ chmod 600 ~/.seaice

Then you should be good to go! For sanity's sake and to create the database 
schema and tables, do: 

  $ ./sea --init-db

To run the WebUI, do 
 
  $ ./ice
  
Open your browser and go to "localhost:5000". Have fun! -Chris
