``Name'' is probably good for ``TermString''

SeaIceDb.cur attribute? The quesiton is whether MySQL serializes
transactions across cursors or only within one. 

The API handles db entries as dictionaries. I'll prboably do this with tuples
instead, since this is more efficient. 

Here are the development stages: 

1. Basic functionality: add/delete/look-up term. Database, API, command-line UI. 

2. Web UI, term ownership, user credentials. Term population, browse terms. 

3. Term discovery via definition search, edit definition form. 

4. Term comment history. 

5. add/delete/look-up relations, discovery via related terms. 

6. Basic scoring (up/down vote), rank search results by score and last
modified. 

7. Vernacular, canon, and archive. Call for votes (term frozen) period.

8. "Elder" nomination (What is an Elder?), refinements to voting scheme.

9. Catch-up and clean up. If time, enhanced term discovery via NLP.
